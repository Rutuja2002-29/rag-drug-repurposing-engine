# RAG Drug Repurposing Engine

## Introduction

This project is a beginner-level prototype based on the concept of Drug Repurposing. The goal is to explore how existing medicines can be studied for new treatment possibilities using basic AI ideas.

## Project Concept

Drug Repurposing means finding new uses for already approved drugs. In this project, we plan to use a simple Retrieval-Augmented approach where the system takes a disease name as input and retrieves related drug information.

Currently, this project is in the prototype stage.

## Phase 1

In the first phase, we created the basic project structure including:

- Data folder  
- Sample data file  
- rag_pipeline.py  
- app.py  
- requirements.txt  
- README.md  

The application was tested to ensure it runs properly.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Streamlit  

## Future Scope

- Add proper retrieval logic  
- Integrate real datasets  
- Improve user interface  

Developed for academic learning purposes.
