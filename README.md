## 🚀 Phase 1 – Basic Setup

In the first phase, we completed the fundamental project structure, including:

- Data folder with sample dataset  
- Core pipeline file (`rag_pipeline.py`)  
- Application interface file (`app.py`)  
- Requirements file  
- Project documentation (`README.md`)  

The application was tested to ensure it runs properly before moving to further development stages.
